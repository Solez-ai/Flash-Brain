## ü§ñ AI FLASHCARD GENERATION (WITH OPENROUTER)

### -- How it Works:
- User clicks **"Flash Cards with AI"**.
- Can **paste unlimited text** into a big input field.
- Uses this **OpenRouter API call** (DeepSeek):

```bash
curl https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer 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" \
  -d '{
    "model": "deepseek/deepseek-r1-0528:free",
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "What is the meaning of life?"
      }
    ]
  }'
-- AI Instructions:
Analyze full study material.

Generate concise flashcards.

Each flashcard should have:

A question and an answer.

Max 10 words per side.

Output structured in [ { question: "...", answer: "..." } ] format.

-- Folder & Storage Behavior:
Same folders/categories used for both manual and AI cards.

No duplicate folder systems.

Cards are saved into chosen folder/category directly.

üóÇ ORGANIZATION STRUCTURE
Folders & Categories System:
On first open, user sees an empty dashboard.

They must:

Create a Category (e.g. "Science", "Math")

Then create a Folder inside it (e.g. "Chapter 3 ‚Äì Atoms")

Then tap + to:

Create flashcards manually

OR generate via AI

Folder Features:
Allow color-coding (example: blue = math, yellow = bio).

Optionally rename or delete folders later.

Organize flashcards inside these folders.

üé® UI/UX / FRONTEND DESIGN
Flashcard Design:
Rounded, card-style container (paper look)

Dynamic text sizing:

Shrinks smoothly as words increase (up to 50)

Background Themes:

Yellow, Pink, or White

Font:

Must be clean, readable, and aesthetic (e.g. Inter, Lexend)

Flashcard Navigation:
Manual Mode:

Auto Mode:

Timer interval chosen by user

Cards autoplay with easing + fade transitions

General UI Guidelines:
Use smooth, soft shadows
