🧠 FlashBrain App Design & Layout Description
FlashBrain is designed with the core philosophy of clarity, elegance, and mental focus. The app should feel light, minimal, and calming, like an organized digital notebook rather than a loud, chaotic tech interface. The entire UI should be distraction-free to help students stay in flow during study sessions. Visual hierarchy is key: content should breathe, sections should be clearly separated with padding and soft contrast, and the entire interface must feel modern and welcoming, never clinical or overwhelming.

Typography should be legible and friendly. A font like Lexend (or similar rounded sans-serif) should be used throughout the app. Font weight and sizing should help distinguish between headings, subheadings, and content. Never use more than two font sizes in a component. Cards should have a dynamic text size that scales down only when necessary (e.g., when over 30 words) — always prioritize readability over cramming in content.

The home screen should be welcoming, with a subtle icon or illustration (like a brain, light bulb, or spark) and a headline like “Welcome to FlashBrain”. Below that, two large buttons: “Create Flashcards Manually” and “Generate with AI”. These buttons must feel tappable and modern — wide, elevated, and color-differentiated (primary purple for manual, yellow or outlined for AI). There should also be a “My Study Folders” section below — showing folders in colored cards with a label, subject icon, and number of cards.

Flashcard folders should appear like sticky notes or lightweight cards — color-coded by user choice (yellow, pink, white). Each should show its category, folder name, and number of flashcards. When a folder is opened, a clean list/grid of flashcards appears. Flashcards themselves should animate smoothly in and out (fade + slide), and tapping one enters Presentation Mode: the card slides in with a flip animation. The card has two sides (question/answer), with a tap or swipe revealing the answer.

In Presentation Mode, allow the user to flip, go next/previous, or set autoplay (3s, 5s, 10s). After the session, display a congratulatory modal with confetti animation and a soft gradient background like “🎉 Great work! Keep practicing.”

Inputs, modals, alerts, and popups should all maintain the soft-paper aesthetic. Focus indicators must be visible but not overly bright. Transitions should be smooth, not snappy — always using ease-in-out or spring curves. Interactions must feel organic and responsive.

The entire app must be mobile-first, using safe-area insets for edge spacing, and all buttons, inputs, and cards must be optimized for touch. Nothing should feel crammed — use vertical spacing (gap: 12px+) to give the brain room to breathe.
