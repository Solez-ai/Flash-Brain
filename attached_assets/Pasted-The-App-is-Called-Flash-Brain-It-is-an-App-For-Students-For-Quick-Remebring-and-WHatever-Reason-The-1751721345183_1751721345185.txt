And Then Deepseek Can Analyze The WHOLE TEXT and Generate Samrt Flahs Cards, The Amount of Flash Cards Will Depepnd On How Big the Pasted Text The Student Gave, Make Sure to Insturct The Ai Some Rules While Genrating the Flash Card Like trying not to go over 10 Words on a Single Card
And The Flash Card UI, UX, GUI etc Will the Be same as the Manual, And Also Remeber The Folders I talked About Will Be The Same No ifferent Folders or Dashbaords For the 2 modes

When The Sudent first Opens The App It Will See an Empyt Directory Where The Srudetn needs to make a Folder or Catergory and Open That and Hit the Plus + Button and Then It will Get The Option To Create the Flashcards

Also i am Using Cursor and Expo For this
